**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND MAY NOT BE FULLY SUITABLE FOR YOUR NEEDS.**

## Status: Hacked together, sorta works, PRs welcome

I've been working on a project in PowerShell lately, and found no existing syntax highlighter extension for Nova, so I
whipped one up and this is the result. It's not perfect (not by a long shot) and needs a lot of love, but it works
"good enough" for my needs for the time being. Pull requests are indeed welcome (so long as they're tested and do
indeed work as intended) as are suggestions. Feature requests may or may not be implemented at my own sole discretion.

You're totally welcome to fork this and do your own thing, too, if you feel you need to for any reason. No problems on
my end with that whatsoever. And if yours ends up in a better state than mine, _fantastic_, let me know and I'll link
to yours instead! No ego here; I just want working syntax highlighting! ðŸ˜ƒ
